# Unsupervised Learning

## What is unsupervised learning?

Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled
datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. Its ability to discover
similarities and differences in information make it the ideal solution for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer
segmentation, and image recognition.

## How unsupervised learning works?

In supervised learning, a data scientist feeds the system with labeled data, for example, the images of cats labeled as cats, allowing 
it to learn by example. In unsupervised learning, a data scientist provides just the photos, and it's the system's responsibility to 
analyze the data and conclude whether they're the images of cats.Unsupervised machine learning requires massive volumes of data. 
In most cases, the same is true for supervised learning as the model becomes more accurate with more examples.The process of unsupervised 
learning begins with the data scientists training the algorithms using the training datasets. The data points in these datasets are
unlabeled and uncategorized.The algorithmâ€™s learning goal is to identify patterns within the dataset and categorize the data points 
based on the same identified patterns. In the example of cat images, the unsupervised learning algorithm can learn to identify the 
distinct features of cats, such as their whiskers, long tails, and retractable claws.
