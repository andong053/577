# Rice-INDE 577 Data Science and Machine Learning

Name: Dong An

This Project is created by Dong An.It contains all projects created in my graduate level INDE 577 Data Science and Machine Learning
course which instrcudted by Randy Davil at Rice University. This data science course covers algorithms from supervised learning, 
unsupervised learning, and if time permits, reinforcement learning. We implement many of the machine learning algorithms from scratch,
but also make use of the Skikit-Learn and Tensorflow libraries.



# Programming Language:

This course relies heavily on programming, and the programming language of choice for many data scientists is python.

# Content

## Supervised Learning:

Model Building and Error Analysis
Linear Regression
Gradient Descent
Logistic Regression
Neural Nets
Support Vector Machines
k-Nearest Neighbors
Decision/ Regression Trees
Ensemble Learning

## Unsupervised Learning:

k-Means Clustering
Principle Component Analysis

# About the data
The data used in these algorithms are from public database,Kaggle[https://www.kaggle.com/]. And the database from canvas 577 files named
"palmer_penguins".
