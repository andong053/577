# Decision/Regression Trees

## Definition

Decision tree builds regression or classification models in the form of a tree structure. It breaks down a dataset into smaller and smaller subsets while at the same time an associated decision tree is incrementally developed. The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes. A decision node (e.g., Outlook) has two or more branches (e.g., Sunny, Overcast and Rainy), each representing values for the attribute tested. Leaf node (e.g., Hours Played) represents a decision on the numerical target. The topmost decision node in a tree which corresponds to the best predictor called root node. Decision trees can handle both categorical and numerical data. 

Each partition represents the data as a graphical decision tree. The primary difference between classification and regression decision trees is that, the classification decision trees are built with unordered values with dependent variables. The regression decision trees take ordered values with continuous values.
