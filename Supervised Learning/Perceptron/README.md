# Perceptron

## Definition

The Perceptron is a linear machine learning algorithm for binary classification tasks.
It may be considered one of the first and one of the simplest types of artificial neural networks. It is definitely not “deep” learning but is an important building block.
Like logistic regression, it can quickly learn a linear separation in feature space for two-class classification tasks, although unlike logistic regression, it learns using the stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithm and does not predict calibrated probabilities.

The Perceptron algorithm is a two-class (binary) classification machine learning algorithm.It is a type of neural network model, perhaps the simplest type of neural network model. It consists of a single node or neuron that takes a row of data as input and predicts a class label. This is achieved by calculating the weighted sum of the inputs and a bias (set to 1). The weighted sum of the input of the model is called the activation.
