# Linear Regression

## What is linear regression?

Linear regression is a basic predictive analytics technique that uses historical data to predict an output variable. It is popular for predictive modelling because it is easily understood and can be explained using plain English.

Linear regression models have many real-world applications in an array of industries such as economics (e.g. predicting growth), business (e.g. predicting product sales, employee performance), social science (e.g. predicting political leanings from gender or race), healthcare (e.g. predicting blood pressure levels from weight, disease onset from biological factors), and more.

Basic concepts and mathematics
There are two kinds of variables in a linear regression model:

The input or predictor variable is the variable(s) that help predict the value of the output variable. It is commonly referred to as X.
The output variable is the variable that we want to predict. It is commonly referred to as Y.

## Linear Regression From Scratch

statsmodels — a module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration.

scikit-learn — a module that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.

## How linear regression works?

The way Linear Regression works is by trying to find the weights (namely, W0 and W1) that lead to the best-fitting line for the input data (i.e. X features) we have. The best-fitting line is determined in terms of lowest cost.
